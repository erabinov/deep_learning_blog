It is hosted using the free platform Hugging Face Spaces, so I may have to periodically rebuild. If it doesn't work for you, raise an issue on the GitHub page, and I will rebuild.\n\nThis is a very simple classifier I built using fastai. It uses an 18-layer neural net (resnet18) to classify sounds as being the songs of one of three species of bird: American Robin, Northern Cardinal, or Blue Jay.\n\n",
