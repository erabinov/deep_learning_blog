    "text": "Hi everybody! My name is Eugene! I’m a postdoc in pure mathematics at the University of Notre Dame. I received my PhD in mathematics from University of California, Berkeley in 2021. My research interests center around mathematical formulations of quantum field theory. As a side/pet project, I am learning about data science and machine learning. This blog is to document some of the things I’m learning. I am using the book Deep Learning for Coders and following the corresponding course from fast.ai."
